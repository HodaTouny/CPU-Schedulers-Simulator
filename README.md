# CPU Scheduling Simulation

This Java program simulates various CPU scheduling algorithms including Non-Preemptive Shortest-Job First (SJF), Shortest-Remaining Time First (SRTF), Non-preemptive Priority Scheduling, and AG Scheduling. The AG Scheduling algorithm is a combination of Round Robin (RR) and additional factors for fair and efficient process execution.

## Schedulers Implemented

1. **Non-Preemptive Shortest-Job First (SJF)**
2. **Shortest-Remaining Time First (SRTF)**
3. **Non-preemptive Priority Scheduling**
4. **AG Scheduling**
   - Round Robin (RR) with AG-Factor calculation
   - Preemptive and Non-preemptive modes
   - Handling of scenarios during process execution
